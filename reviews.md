General Comments:

1. Your website looks pretty and your code is well organized. 
2. I like the preview functionality since it allow users to get an idea of what your app looks like.
3. I think you should restrict users' right to delete posts on your website.
This can be dangerous since anyone can register an account and delete everything in your database.
4. I think the .idea folder should be gitnore.
